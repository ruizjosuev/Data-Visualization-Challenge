Based on the analysis of the results, it appears that Capomulin is the most promising treatment, showing lower tumor volumes and a significant reduction in tumor size over time. Ramicane also appears effective, with similar results to Capomulin, while Infubinol and Ceftamin show higher median tumor volumes and greater variability, suggesting less consistent efficacy. The gender distribution of the mice is nearly equal, ensuring no bias in the results, and the tumor volume comparison by sex reveals that the effects of the drugs are consistent across genders. Additionally, there is a moderate positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, indicating that heavier mice tend to have larger tumors. Overall, Capomulin stands out as the most effective treatment.
